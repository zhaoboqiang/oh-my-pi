# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed context overflow detection to recognize `model_context_window_exceeded` from z.ai / GLM providers, preventing infinite retry loops when context window is exceeded ([#638](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/638))


## [14.1.0] - 2026-04-11
### Added

- Added `accountId` to usage report metadata

### Changed

- Changed usage parsing to emit a usage report with available fields when parsing fails, rather than returning null

### Fixed

- Fixed `planType` resolution to fall back to the raw payload `plan_type` when parsed value is absent
- Fixed usage metadata `raw` fallback to preserve the original payload when parsed raw output is missing

## [14.0.5] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Replaced GitHub Copilot authentication from VSCode extension impersonation to the opencode OAuth flow, eliminating TOS concerns. Existing users will need to re-authenticate once with `/login github-copilot`.
- Simplified Copilot token handling: GitHub OAuth token is used directly for all API requests (no JWT exchange or refresh cycle).
- Changed GitHub Copilot API base URL from `api.individual.githubcopilot.com` to `api.githubcopilot.com`.
- Updated default OpenAI stream idle timeout to 120,000 milliseconds to keep stream generation alive longer

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate synthetic tool results being generated when a real tool result appears later in message history
- Fixed GitHub Copilot `/models` discovery to unwrap structured OAuth credentials before sending the bearer token, preserving dynamic catalog refresh for OAuth-backed callers.

### Removed
- Removed Copilot JWT proxy-ep base URL resolution (no longer needed with opencode auth).

## [14.0.3] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Fixed Ollama discovery cache normalization so cached models upgrade to the OpenAI Responses transport after the provider change

## [14.0.0] - 2026-04-08
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `coerceNullStrings` function and its automatic null-string coercion behavior from JSON parsing

### Added

- Added support for OpenRouter provider with strict mode detection
- Added automatic cleaning of literal escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, `\r`) in JSON parsing to handle LLM encoding confusion
- Added support for healing JSON with trailing junk after balanced containers (e.g., `]\n</invoke>`)
- Added `CODEX_STARTUP_EVENT_CHANNEL` constant and `CodexStartupEvent` type for monitoring Codex provider initialization status
- Added automatic healing of malformed JSON with single-character bracket errors at the end of strings, improving LLM tool argument parsing robustness

## [13.19.0] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini 2.5 Pro context window detection in GitHub Copilot model limits test
- Fixed Claude Opus 4.6 context window detection in GitHub Copilot model limits test
- Fixed Anthropic streaming to suppress transient SDK console errors for malformed SSE keep-alive frames so the TUI only shows surfaced provider errors

- Added environment-based credential fallback for the OpenAI Codex provider.
## [13.17.6] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic first-event timeouts to exclude stream connection setup from the watchdog, preserve timeout-specific retry classification after local aborts, and reset retry state cleanly between attempts

## [13.17.5] - 2026-04-01
### Changed

- Increased default first-event timeout from 15s to 45s to better accommodate longer request setup times
- Modified first-event watchdog to inherit idle timeout when it exceeds the default, ensuring consistent timeout behavior across different configurations

### Fixed

- Fixed first-event watchdog initialization timing so it no longer starts before the actual stream request is created, preventing premature timeouts during request setup
- Fixed first-event watchdog timing so OpenAI-family providers no longer count slow request setup against the first streamed event timeout, and raised the default first-event timeout to avoid false aborts after long tool turns

## [13.17.2] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI-family first-event timeouts to preserve provider-specific timeout errors for retry classification instead of flattening them to generic aborts ([#591](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/591))

## [13.17.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Added `thinkingSignature` field to thinking content blocks to preserve the original reasoning field name (e.g., `reasoning_text`, `reasoning_content`) for accurate follow-up requests
- Added first-event timeout detection for streaming responses to abort stuck requests before user-visible content arrives
- Added `PI_STREAM_FIRST_EVENT_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable to configure first-event timeout (defaults to 15 seconds or idle timeout, whichever is lower)

### Changed

- Changed thinking block handling to track and distinguish between different reasoning field types, enabling proper field name preservation across multiple turns

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic stream timeout errors to be properly retried by recognizing first-event timeout messages
- Fixed stream stall detection to distinguish between first-event timeouts and idle timeouts, enabling faster recovery for stuck connections

### Added

- Added Vercel AI Gateway to `/login` providers for interactive API key setup

### Fixed
- Fixed `omp commit` failing with HTTP 400 errors when using reasoning-enabled models on OpenAI-compatible endpoints that don't support the `developer` role (e.g., GitHub Copilot, custom proxies). Now falls back to `system` role when `developer` is unsupported.

## [13.3.14] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Exported schema utilities from new `./utils/schema` module, consolidating JSON Schema handling across providers
- Added `CredentialRankingStrategy` interface for providers to implement usage-based credential selection
- Added `claudeRankingStrategy` for Anthropic OAuth credentials to enable smart multi-account selection based on usage windows
- Added `codexRankingStrategy` for OpenAI Codex OAuth credentials with priority boost for fresh 5-hour window starts
- Added `adaptSchemaForStrict()` helper for unified OpenAI strict schema enforcement across providers
- Added schema equality and merging utilities: `areJsonValuesEqual()`, `mergeCompatibleEnumSchemas()`, `mergePropertySchemas()`
- Added Cloud Code Assist schema normalization: `copySchemaWithout()`, `stripResidualCombiners()`, `prepareSchemaForCCA()`
- Added `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle()` and `sanitizeSchemaForCCA()` for provider-specific schema sanitization
- Added `StringEnum()` helper for creating string enum schemas compatible with Google and other providers
- Added `enforceStrictSchema()` and `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode()` for OpenAI strict mode schema validation
- Added package exports for `./utils/schema` and `./utils/schema/*` subpaths
- Added `validateSchemaCompatibility()` to statically audit a JSON Schema against provider-specific rules (`openai-strict`, `google`, `cloud-code-assist-claude`) and return structured violations
- Added `validateStrictSchemaEnforcement()` to verify the strict-fail-open contract: enforced schemas pass strict validation, failed schemas return the original object identity
- Added `COMBINATOR_KEYS` (`anyOf`, `allOf`, `oneOf`) and `CCA_UNSUPPORTED_SCHEMA_FIELDS` as exported constants in `fields.ts` to eliminate duplication across modules
- Added `tryEnforceStrictSchema` result cache (`WeakMap`) to avoid redundant sanitize + enforce work for the same schema object
- Added comprehensive schema normalization test suite (`schema-normalization.test.ts`) covering strict mode, Google, and Cloud Code Assist normalization paths
- Added schema compatibility validation test suite (`schema-compatibility.test.ts`) covering all three provider targets

### Changed

- Moved schema utilities from `./utils/typebox-helpers` to new `./utils/schema` module with expanded functionality
- Refactored OpenAI provider tool conversion to use unified `adaptSchemaForStrict()` helper across codex, completions, and responses
- Updated `AuthStorage` to support generic credential ranking via `CredentialRankingStrategy` instead of Codex-only logic
- Moved Google schema sanitization functions from `google-shared.ts` to `./utils/schema` module
- Changed export path: `./utils/typebox-helpers` → `./utils/schema` in main index
- `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle()` / `sanitizeSchemaForCCA()` now accept a parameterized `unsupportedFields` set internally, enabling code reuse between the two sanitizers
- `copySchemaWithout()` rewritten using object-rest destructuring for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed cycle detection: `WeakSet` guards added to all recursive schema traversals (`sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode`, `enforceStrictSchema`, `normalizeSchemaForCCA`, `normalizeNullablePropertiesForCloudCodeAssist`, `stripResidualCombiners`, `sanitizeSchemaImpl`, `hasResidualCloudCodeAssistIncompatibilities`) — circular schemas no longer cause infinite loops or stack overflows
- Fixed `hasResidualCloudCodeAssistIncompatibilities`: cycle detection now returns `false` (not `true`) for already-visited nodes, eliminating false positives that forced the CCA fallback schema on valid recursive inputs
- Fixed `stripResidualCombiners` to iterate to a fixpoint rather than making a single pass, ensuring chained combiner reductions (where one reduction enables another) are fully resolved
- Fixed `mergeObjectCombinerVariants` required-field computation: the flattened object now takes the intersection of all variants' `required` arrays (unioned with own-level required properties that exist in the merged schema), preventing required fields from being silently dropped or over-included
- Fixed `mergeCompatibleEnumSchemas` to use deep structural equality (`areJsonValuesEqual`) instead of `Object.is` when deduplicating object-valued enum members
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` const-to-enum deduplication to use deep equality instead of reference equality
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` type inference for `anyOf`/`oneOf`-flattened const enums: type is now derived from all variants (must agree), falling back to inference from enum values; mixed null/non-null infers the non-null type and sets `nullable`
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` recursion to spread options when descending (previously only `insideProperties`, `normalizeTypeArrayToNullable`, `stripNullableKeyword` were forwarded; new fields `unsupportedFields` and `seen` were silently dropped)
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` array-valued `type` filtering to exclude non-string entries before processing
- Removed incorrect `additionalProperties: false` stripping from `sanitizeSchemaForGoogle` (the field is valid in Google schemas when `false`)
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to strip the `nullable` keyword and expand it into `anyOf: [schema, {type: "null"}]` in the output, matching what OpenAI strict mode actually expects
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to infer `type: "array"` when `items` is present but `type` is absent
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` to infer a scalar `type` from uniform `enum` values when `type` is not explicitly set
- Fixed `sanitizeSchemaForStrictMode` const-to-enum merge to use deep equality, preventing duplicate enum entries when `const` and `enum` both exist with the same value
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to drop `additionalProperties` unconditionally (previously only object-valued `additionalProperties` was recursed into; non-object values were passed through, violating strict schema requirements)
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to recurse into `$defs` and `definitions` blocks so referenced sub-schemas are also made strict-compliant
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` to handle tuple-style `items` arrays (previously only single-schema `items` objects were recursed)
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` double-wrapping: optional properties already expressed as `anyOf: [..., {type: "null"}]` are not wrapped again
- Fixed `enforceStrictSchema` `Array.isArray` type-narrowing for `type` field to filter non-string entries before checking for `"object"`

### Changed

- Changed strict mode handling in OpenAI providers to use `tryEnforceStrictSchema` for safer schema enforcement with automatic fallback to non-strict mode

- Anthropic provider now maps tool names to Claude Code's exact tool names (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob) instead of using prefixed names
- OpenAI Completions provider now disables strict mode on tools to allow optional parameters without null unions

### Fixed

- Fixed Anthropic OAuth code parsing to accept full redirect URLs in addition to raw authorization codes
- Fixed Anthropic token refresh to preserve existing refresh token when server doesn't return a new one
- Fixed thinking mode being enabled when tool_choice forces a specific tool, which is unsupported
- Fixed max_tokens being too low when thinking budget is set, now auto-adjusts to model's maxTokens
- Google Cloud Code Assist OAuth for paid subscriptions: properly handles long-running operations for project provisioning, supports `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` / `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` env vars for paid tiers
- `os.homedir()` calls at module load time; now resolved lazily when needed
- OpenAI Responses tool strict flag to use a boolean for LM Studio compatibility
- Gemini CLI abort handling: detect native `AbortError` in retry catch block, cancel SSE reader when abort signal fires
- Antigravity provider 429 errors by aligning request payload with CLIProxyAPI v6.6.89
- Thinking block handling for cross-model conversations: thinking blocks are now converted to plain text when switching models
- OpenAI Codex context window from 400,000 to 272,000 tokens to match Codex CLI defaults
- Codex SSE error events to surface message, code, and status
- Context overflow detection for `context_length_exceeded` error codes
- Codex provider now always includes `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when custom `include` options are passed
- Codex requests now omit the `reasoning` field entirely when thinking is off
- Crash when pasting text with trailing whitespace exceeding terminal width

## [3.37.1] - 2026-01-10

### Added

- Added automatic type coercion for tool arguments when LLMs return JSON-encoded strings instead of native types (numbers, booleans, arrays, objects)

### Changed

- Changed tool argument validation to attempt JSON parsing and type coercion before rejecting mismatched types
- Changed validation error messages to include both original and normalized arguments when coercion was attempted

## [3.37.0] - 2026-01-10

### Changed

- Enabled type coercion in JSON schema validation to automatically convert compatible types

## [3.35.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Enhanced error messages to include retry-after timing information from API rate limit headers

## [0.42.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- Added OpenCode Zen provider support with 26 models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, etc.). Set `OPENCODE_API_KEY` env var to use.

## [0.39.0] - 2026-01-08

### Fixed

- Fixed Gemini CLI abort handling: detect native `AbortError` in retry catch block, cancel SSE reader when abort signal fires ([#568](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/568) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed Antigravity provider 429 errors by aligning request payload with CLIProxyAPI v6.6.89: inject Antigravity system instruction with `role: "user"`, set `requestType: "agent"`, and use `antigravity` userAgent. Added bridge prompt to override Antigravity behavior (identity, paths, web dev guidelines) with Pi defaults. ([#571](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/571) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas))
- Fixed thinking block handling for cross-model conversations: thinking blocks are now converted to plain text (no `<thinking>` tags) when switching models. Previously, `<thinking>` tags caused models to mimic the pattern and output literal tags. Also fixed empty thinking blocks causing API errors. ([#561](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/561))

## [0.38.0] - 2026-01-08

### Added

- `thinkingBudgets` option in `SimpleStreamOptions` for customizing token budgets per thinking level on token-based providers ([#529](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/529) by [@melihmucuk](https://github.com/melihmucuk))

### Breaking Changes

- Removed OpenAI Codex model aliases (`gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5-nano`, `codex-mini-latest`, `gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1-codex`, `gpt-5.1-chat-latest`). Use canonical model IDs: `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-max`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5.2-codex`. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))

### Fixed

- Fixed OpenAI Codex context window from 400,000 to 272,000 tokens to match Codex CLI defaults and prevent 400 errors. ([#536](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/536) by [@ghoulr](https://github.com/ghoulr))
- Fixed Codex SSE error events to surface message, code, and status. ([#551](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/551) by [@tmustier](https://github.com/tmustier))
- Fixed context overflow detection for `context_length_exceeded` error codes.

## [0.37.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- Exported OpenAI Codex utilities: `CacheMetadata`, `getCodexInstructions`, `getModelFamily`, `ModelFamily`, `buildCodexPiBridge`, `buildCodexSystemPrompt`, `CodexSystemPrompt` ([#510](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/510) by [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko))

## [0.37.3] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- `sessionId` option in `StreamOptions` for providers that support session-based caching. OpenAI Codex provider uses this to set `prompt_cache_key` and routing headers.

## [0.37.2] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

- Codex provider now always includes `reasoning.encrypted_content` even when custom `include` options are passed ([#484](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/484) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

## [0.37.0] - 2026-01-05

### Breaking Changes

- OpenAI Codex models no longer have per-thinking-level variants (e.g., `gpt-5.2-codex-high`). Use the base model ID and set thinking level separately. The Codex provider clamps reasoning effort to what each model supports internally. (initial implementation by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas) in [#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

### Added

- Headless OAuth support for all callback-server providers (Google Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenAI Codex): paste redirect URL when browser callback is unreachable ([#428](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/428) by [@ben-vargas](https://github.com/ben-vargas), [#468](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/468) by [@crcatala](https://github.com/crcatala))
- Cancellable GitHub Copilot device code polling via AbortSignal

### Fixed

- Codex requests now omit the `reasoning` field entirely when thinking is off, letting the backend use its default instead of forcing a value. ([#472](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/472))

## [0.36.0] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- OpenAI Codex OAuth provider with Responses API streaming support: `openai-codex-responses` streaming provider with SSE parsing, tool-call handling, usage/cost tracking, and PKCE OAuth flow ([#451](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/451) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Fixed

- Vertex AI dummy value for `getEnvApiKey()`: Returns `"<authenticated>"` when Application Default Credentials are configured (`~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` exists) and both `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (or `GCLOUD_PROJECT`) and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` are set. This allows `streamSimple()` to work with Vertex AI without explicit `apiKey` option. The ADC credentials file existence check is cached per-process to avoid repeated filesystem access.

## [0.32.3] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- Google Vertex AI models no longer appear in available models list without explicit authentication. Previously, `getEnvApiKey()` returned a dummy value for `google-vertex`, causing models to show up even when Google Cloud ADC was not configured.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Vertex AI provider with ADC (Application Default Credentials) support. Authenticate with `gcloud auth application-default login`, set `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` and `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and access Gemini models via Vertex AI. ([#300](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/300) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

### Fixed

- **Gemini CLI rate limit handling**: Added automatic retry with server-provided delay for 429 errors. Parses delay from error messages like "Your quota will reset after 39s" and waits accordingly. Falls back to exponential backoff for other transient errors. ([#370](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/370))

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

- **Agent API moved**: All agent functionality (`agentLoop`, `agentLoopContinue`, `AgentContext`, `AgentEvent`, `AgentTool`, `AgentToolResult`, etc.) has moved to `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`. Import from that package instead of `@oh-my-pi/pi-ai`.

### Added

- **`GoogleThinkingLevel` type**: Exported type that mirrors Google's `ThinkingLevel` enum values (`"THINKING_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED" | "MINIMAL" | "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH"`). Allows configuring Gemini thinking levels without importing from `@google/genai`.
- **`ANTHROPIC_OAUTH_TOKEN` env var**: Now checked before `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `getEnvApiKey()`, allowing OAuth tokens to take precedence.
- **`event-stream.js` export**: `AssistantMessageEventStream` utility now exported from package index.

### Changed

- **OAuth uses Web Crypto API**: PKCE generation and OAuth flows now use Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) instead of Node.js `crypto` module. This improves browser compatibility while still working in Node.js 20+.
- **Deterministic model generation**: `generate-models.ts` now sorts providers and models alphabetically for consistent output across runs. ([#332](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/332) by [@mrexodia](https://github.com/mrexodia))

### Fixed

- **OpenAI completions empty content blocks**: Empty text or thinking blocks in assistant messages are now filtered out before sending to the OpenAI completions API, preventing validation errors. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))
- **Thinking token duplication**: Fixed thinking content duplication with chutes.ai provider. The provider was returning thinking content in both `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` fields, causing each chunk to be processed twice. Now only the first non-empty reasoning field is used.
- **zAi provider API mapping**: Fixed zAi models to use `openai-completions` API with correct base URL (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4`) instead of incorrect Anthropic API mapping. ([#344](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/344), [#358](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/358) by [@default-anton](https://github.com/default-anton))

## [0.28.0] - 2025-12-25

### Breaking Changes

- **OAuth storage removed** ([#296](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/296)): All storage functions (`loadOAuthCredentials`, `saveOAuthCredentials`, `setOAuthStorage`, etc.) removed. Callers are responsible for storing credentials.
- **OAuth login functions**: `loginAnthropic`, `loginGitHubCopilot`, `loginGeminiCli`, `loginAntigravity` now return `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving to disk.
- **refreshOAuthToken**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns new `OAuthCredentials` instead of saving.
- **getOAuthApiKey**: Now takes `(provider, credentials)` and returns `{ newCredentials, apiKey }` or null.
- **OAuthCredentials type**: No longer includes `type: "oauth"` discriminator. Callers add discriminator when storing.
- **setApiKey, resolveApiKey**: Removed. Callers must manage their own API key storage/resolution.
- **getApiKey**: Renamed to `getEnvApiKey`. Only checks environment variables for known providers.

## [0.27.7] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed

- **Thinking tag leakage**: Fixed Claude mimicking literal `</thinking>` tags in responses. Unsigned thinking blocks (from aborted streams) are now converted to plain text without `<thinking>` tags. The TUI still displays them as thinking blocks. ([#302](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/302) by [@nicobailon](https://github.com/nicobailon))

## [0.25.1] - 2025-12-21

### Added

- **xhigh thinking level support**: Added `supportsXhigh()` function to check if a model supports xhigh reasoning level. Also clamps xhigh to high for OpenAI models that don't support it. ([#236](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/236) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

### Fixed

- **Gemini multimodal tool results**: Fixed images in tool results causing flaky/broken responses with Gemini models. For Gemini 3, images are now nested inside `functionResponse.parts` per the [docs](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling#multimodal). For older models (which don't support multimodal function responses), images are sent in a separate user message.

- **Queued message steering**: When `getQueuedMessages` is provided, the agent loop now checks for queued user messages after each tool call and skips remaining tool calls in the current assistant message when a queued message arrives (emitting error tool results).

- **Double API version path in Google provider URL**: Fixed Gemini API calls returning 404 after baseUrl support was added. The SDK was appending its default apiVersion to baseUrl which already included the version path. ([#251](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/251) by [@shellfyred](https://github.com/shellfyred))

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Re-enabled SDK-level retries (default 2) for transient HTTP failures. ([#252](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/252))

## [0.23.5] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- **Gemini 3 Flash thinking support**: Extended thinking level support for Gemini 3 Flash models (MINIMAL, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH) to match Pro models' capabilities. ([#212](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/212) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

- **GitHub Copilot thinking models**: Added thinking support for additional Copilot models (o3-mini, o1-mini, o1-preview). ([#234](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/234) by [@aadishv](https://github.com/aadishv))

### Fixed

- **Gemini tool result format**: Fixed tool result format for Gemini 3 Flash Preview which strictly requires `{ output: value }` for success and `{ error: value }` for errors. Previous format using `{ result, isError }` was rejected by newer Gemini models. Also improved type safety by removing `as any` casts. ([#213](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/213), [#220](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/220))

- **Google baseUrl configuration**: Google provider now respects `baseUrl` configuration for custom endpoints or API proxies. ([#216](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/216), [#221](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/221) by [@theBucky](https://github.com/theBucky))

- **GitHub Copilot vision requests**: Added `Copilot-Vision-Request` header when sending images to GitHub Copilot models. ([#222](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/222))

- **GitHub Copilot X-Initiator header**: Fixed X-Initiator logic to check last message role instead of any message in history. This ensures proper billing when users send follow-up messages. ([#209](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/209))

## [0.22.3] - 2025-12-16

### Added

- **Image limits test suite**: Added comprehensive tests for provider-specific image limitations (max images, max size, max dimensions). Discovered actual limits: Anthropic (100 images, 5MB, 8000px), OpenAI (500 images, ≥25MB), Gemini (~2500 images, ≥40MB), Mistral (8 images, ~15MB), OpenRouter (~40 images context-limited, ~15MB). ([#120](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/120))

- **Tool result streaming**: Added `tool_execution_update` event and optional `onUpdate` callback to `AgentTool.execute()` for streaming tool output during execution. Tools can now emit partial results (e.g., bash stdout) that are forwarded to subscribers. ([#44](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/44))

- **X-Initiator header for GitHub Copilot**: Added X-Initiator header handling for GitHub Copilot provider to ensure correct call accounting (agent calls are not deducted from quota). Sets initiator based on last message role. ([#200](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/200) by [@kim0](https://github.com/kim0))

### Changed

- **Normalized tool_execution_end result**: `tool_execution_end` event now always contains `AgentToolResult` (no longer `AgentToolResult | string`). Errors are wrapped in the standard result format.

### Fixed

- **Reasoning disabled by default**: When `reasoning` option is not specified, thinking is now explicitly disabled for all providers. Previously, some providers like Gemini with "dynamic thinking" would use their default (thinking ON), causing unexpected token usage. This was the original intended behavior. ([#180](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/180) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.22.2] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Added `interleavedThinking` option to `AnthropicOptions`. When enabled, Claude 4 models can think between tool calls and reason after receiving tool results. Enabled by default (no extra token cost, just unlocks the capability). Set `interleavedThinking: false` to disable.

## [0.22.1] - 2025-12-15

_Dedicated to Peter's shoulder ([@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete))_

### Added

- **Interleaved thinking for Anthropic**: Enabled interleaved thinking in the Anthropic provider, allowing Claude models to output thinking blocks interspersed with text responses.

## [0.22.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- **GitHub Copilot provider**: Added `github-copilot` as a known provider with models sourced from models.dev. Includes Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, and other models available through GitHub Copilot. ([#191](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/191) by [@cau1k](https://github.com/cau1k))

### Fixed

- **GitHub Copilot gpt-5 models**: Fixed API selection for gpt-5 models to use `openai-responses` instead of `openai-completions` (gpt-5 models are not accessible via completions endpoint)

- **GitHub Copilot cross-model context handoff**: Fixed context handoff failing when switching between GitHub Copilot models using different APIs (e.g., gpt-5 to claude-sonnet-4). Tool call IDs from OpenAI Responses API were incompatible with other models. ([#198](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/198))

- **Gemini 3 Pro thinking levels**: Thinking level configuration now works correctly for Gemini 3 Pro models. Previously all levels mapped to -1 (minimal thinking). Now LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH properly control test-time computation. ([#176](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/176) by [@markusylisiurunen](https://github.com/markusylisiurunen))

## [0.18.2] - 2025-12-11

### Changed

- **Anthropic SDK retries disabled**: Set `maxRetries: 0` on Anthropic client to allow application-level retry handling. The SDK's built-in retries were interfering with coding-agent's retry logic. ([#157](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/157))

## [0.18.1] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Mistral provider**: Added support for Mistral AI models via the OpenAI-compatible API. Includes automatic handling of Mistral-specific requirements (tool call ID format). Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` environment variable to use.

### Fixed

- Fixed Mistral 400 errors after aborted assistant messages by skipping empty assistant messages (no content, no tool calls) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Removed synthetic assistant bridge message after tool results for Mistral (no longer required as of Dec 2025) ([#165](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/165))

- Fixed bug where `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable was deleted globally after first OAuth token usage, causing subsequent prompts to fail ([#164](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/pull/164))

## [0.17.0] - 2025-12-09

### Added

- **`agentLoopContinue` function**: Continue an agent loop from existing context without adding a new user message. Validates that the last message is `user` or `toolResult`. Useful for retry after context overflow or resuming from manually-added tool results.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed provider-level tool argument validation. Validation now happens in `agentLoop` via `executeToolCalls`, allowing models to retry on validation errors. For manual tool execution, use `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` or `validateToolArguments(tool, toolCall)`.

### Added

- Added `validateToolCall(tools, toolCall)` helper that finds the tool by name and validates arguments.

- **OpenAI compatibility overrides**: Added `compat` field to `Model` for `openai-completions` API, allowing explicit configuration of provider quirks (`supportsStore`, `supportsDeveloperRole`, `supportsReasoningEffort`, `maxTokensField`). Falls back to URL-based detection if not set. Useful for LiteLLM, custom proxies, and other non-standard endpoints. ([#133](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/133), thanks @fink-andreas for the initial idea and PR)

- **xhigh reasoning level**: Added `xhigh` to `ReasoningEffort` type for OpenAI codex-max models. For non-OpenAI providers (Anthropic, Google), `xhigh` is automatically mapped to `high`. ([#143](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/issues/143))

### Changed

- **Updated SDK versions**: OpenAI SDK 5.21.0 → 6.10.0, Anthropic SDK 0.61.0 → 0.71.2, Google GenAI SDK 1.30.0 → 1.31.0

## [0.13.0] - 2025-12-06

### Breaking Changes

- **Added `totalTokens` field to `Usage` type**: All code that constructs `Usage` objects must now include the `totalTokens` field. This field represents the total tokens processed by the LLM (input + output + cache). For OpenAI and Google, this uses native API values (`total_tokens`, `totalTokenCount`). For Anthropic, it's computed as `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`.

## [0.12.10] - 2025-12-04

### Added

- Added `gpt-5.1-codex-max` model support

### Fixed

- **OpenAI Token Counting**: Fixed `usage.input` to exclude cached tokens for OpenAI providers. Previously, `input` included cached tokens, causing double-counting when calculating total context size via `input + cacheRead`. Now `input` represents non-cached input tokens across all providers, making `input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite` the correct formula for total context size.

- **Fixed Claude Opus 4.5 cache pricing** (was 3x too expensive)
  - Corrected cache_read: $1.50 → $0.50 per MTok
  - Corrected cache_write: $18.75 → $6.25 per MTok
  - Added manual override in `scripts/generate-models.ts` until upstream fix is merged
  - Submitted PR to models.dev: https://github.com/sst/models.dev/pull/439

## [0.9.4] - 2025-11-26

Initial release with multi-provider LLM support.
