# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Breaking Changes

- Moved package entry point from `src/index.ts` to `native/index.js` — consumers must update imports to use the new native module path
- Removed TypeScript source files from `src/` directory — all APIs now exported from auto-generated `native/index.js` with types in `native/index.d.ts`
- Changed enum exports to runtime objects — `const enum` values are now available at runtime via generated enum exports in `native/index.js`

### Added

- Generated native module bindings in `native/index.js` and `native/index.d.ts` from napi-rs build output
- Added `gen-enums.ts` script to extract and export runtime enum values from TypeScript const enums
- Added `embedded-addon.js` for managing embedded native addon variants and metadata

### Changed

- Refactored build pipeline to use napi-rs generated bindings instead of hand-written TypeScript wrappers
- Updated `build-native.ts` to generate runtime enum exports after native compilation
- Updated `embed-native.ts` to output JavaScript instead of TypeScript for embedded addon metadata

### Removed

- Removed all TypeScript wrapper modules from `src/` directory (appearance, ast, chunk, clipboard, glob, grep, highlight, html, image, keys, projfs, ps, pty, shell, text, work)
- Removed `src/bindings.ts` and `src/index.ts` entry points
- Removed `src/search-db.ts` and `src/search-db-types.ts`

## [13.16.1] - 2026-03-27

### Added

- Exported `SearchDb` class from main package entry point for direct instantiation
- Added `SearchDb` class for stateful shared search database instances to improve performance across multiple search operations
- Added optional `db` parameter to `grep()`, `glob()`, and `fuzzyFind()` functions to enable database-backed searching

- Replaced `AstReplaceOptions.pattern` and `rewrite` with single `rewrites` option (Record<string, string>)

### Added

- `astGrep` now accepts multiple patterns in a single call; results from all patterns are merged and sorted by file path then position before offset/limit are applied
- `astEdit` now accepts a `rewrites` map (`Record<string, string>`) and applies all patterns per file in a single pass, compiling them once upfront
- Result ordering in `astGrep` is now deterministic: sorted by path, line, column using `BTreeSet`/`BTreeMap`
