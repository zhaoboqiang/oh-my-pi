## [13.5.4] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- Fixed viewport repaint scrollback accounting during resize oscillation to avoid double-scrolling on height shrink and added exact-row scrollback assertions in overlay regression coverage ([#228](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/228), [#234](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/234))

## [13.5.2] - 2026-03-01
### Breaking Changes

- Removed `getMermaidImage` callback from MarkdownTheme; replaced with `getMermaidAscii` that accepts ASCII string instead of image data
- Removed mermaid module exports (`renderMermaidToPng`, `extractMermaidBlocks`, `prerenderMermaidBlocks`, `MermaidImage` interface)

### Changed

## [13.5.1] - 2026-03-01
### Fixed

- Fixed viewport shift handling to prevent stale content when mixed updates remap screen rows

## [13.5.0] - 2026-03-01

### Breaking Changes

- Removed `PI_TUI_RESIZE_CLEAR_STRATEGY`; resize behavior is no longer configurable between viewport/scrollback modes. The renderer now uses fixed semantics: width changes perform a hard reset (`3J` + full content rewrite), while height changes and diff fallbacks use viewport-scoped repainting.

### Added

- Added a new terminal regression suite in `packages/tui/test/render-regressions.test.ts` covering no-op render stability, targeted middle-line diffs, shrink cleanup, width-resize truncation without ghost rows, shrink/grow viewport tail anchoring, scrollback deduplication across forced redraws, overlay restore behavior, and rapid mutation convergence.
- Expanded `packages/tui/test/overlay-scroll.test.ts` with stress coverage for overflow shrink/regrow cycles, resize oscillation, overlay toggle churn, no-op render loops, and hardware-cursor-only updates while bounding scrollback growth and blank-run artifacts.

### Changed

- Refactored render orchestration to explicit `hardReset` and `viewportRepaint` paths, with targeted fallbacks for offscreen diff ranges and unsafe row deltas.
- Switched startup to `requestRender(true)` so the first frame always initializes renderer state with a forced full path.
- Replaced legacy viewport bookkeeping (`previousViewportTop`) with `viewportTopRow` tracking and consistent screen-relative cursor calculations.
- Updated stop-sequence cursor placement to target the visible working area and clamp to terminal bounds before final newline emission.
- Documented the intentional performance policy of not forcing full repaint on every viewport-top shift, relying on narrower safety guards instead.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale/duplicated terminal cursor dedup state by synchronizing `#lastCursorSequence` in all render write paths (hard reset, viewport repaint, deleted-lines clear path, append fast path, and differential path).
- Fixed scroll overshoot on `stop()` when content fills the viewport by clamping target row movement to valid screen rows.
## [13.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Added `PI_TUI_RESIZE_CLEAR_STRATEGY` environment variable to control terminal behavior on resize: `viewport` (default) clears/redraws the viewport while preserving scrollback, or `scrollback` clears all history

### Changed

- Changed resize redraw behavior to use configurable clear semantics (`viewport` vs `scrollback`) while keeping full content rendering for scrollback navigation

### Fixed

- Fixed loader component rendering lines wider than terminal width, preventing text overflow and display artifacts

## [13.3.11] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Restored terminal image protocol override and fallback detection for image rendering, including `PI_FORCE_IMAGE_PROTOCOL` support and Kitty fallback for screen/tmux/ghostty-style TERM environments.

## [13.3.8] - 2026-02-28
### Breaking Changes

- Changed mermaid hash type from string to bigint in `getMermaidImage` callback and `extractMermaidBlocks` return type
- Removed `mime-types` and `@types/mime-types` from dependencies
- Removed `@xterm/xterm` from dependencies

### Changed

## [12.19.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Added `getTopBorderAvailableWidth()` method to calculate available width for top border content accounting for border characters and padding

### Fixed

- Fixed stale viewport rows appearing when terminal height increases by triggering full re-render on height changes

## [12.18.0] - 2026-02-21
### Fixed

- Fixed viewport synchronization issue by clearing scrollback when terminal state becomes desynced during full re-renders

## [12.12.2] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- Fixed non-forced full re-renders clearing terminal scrollback history during streaming updates by limiting scrollback clears to explicit forced re-renders.

## [12.12.0] - 2026-02-19

### Added

- Added PageUp/PageDown navigation for editor content and autocomplete selection to jump across long wrapped inputs faster.

### Fixed

- Fixed history-entry navigation anchoring (Up opens at top, Down opens at bottom) and preserved editor scroll context when max-height changes to keep cursor movement visible in long prompts ([#99](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi/issues/99)).

## [12.11.3] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed

- Fixed differential deleted-line rendering when content shrinks to empty so stale first-row content is cleared reliably.
- Fixed incremental stale-row clearing to use erase-below semantics in synchronized output, reducing leftover-line artifacts after shrink operations.
